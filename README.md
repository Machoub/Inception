## üìå Project Overview

**Inception** is a DevOps project aimed at introducing the basics of system administration, container orchestration, and secure service deployment using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

The goal is to set up a complete WordPress website running on a LEMP stack inside containers, with persistent volumes, domain SSL, and robust configuration management.

---

## üß† Objectives

- Use **Docker** to containerize services.
- Use **Docker Compose** to orchestrate them.
- Set up a secure WordPress site with:
  - **NGINX** reverse proxy
  - **MariaDB** database
  - **PHP-FPM** backend
- Secure the site with **SSL (TLS)** certificates via **OpenSSL**.
- Implement **volumes** to persist data (WordPress, DB).
- Isolate services into individual containers.
- Ensure the whole stack runs on **localhost only**.
- Bonus: Add extra services like Redis, Adminer, static site, FTP, etc.
